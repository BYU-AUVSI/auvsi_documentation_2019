This code is intended to outline the code that will be used to control the UAV for obstacle avoidance. At the beginning of the flight, the initial path will be calculated in order to avoid static obstacles. During the flight, deviations to the pre-planned flight path will be recalculated in order to avoid dynamic obstacles while still maintaining the flight path.
