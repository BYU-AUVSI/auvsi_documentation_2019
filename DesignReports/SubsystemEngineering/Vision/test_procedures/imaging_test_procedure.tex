\section{Introduction}

In order to verify that the imaging subsystem independently meets its key success
measures a series of tests and procedures were developed. Requirements for the subsystem
can be seen in IM-007. However, some of the subsystem's requirements cannot be fully
measured until it is integrated with the full system and testing in flight.

\section{Continuous Integration}

A prerequisite to meeting our key success measures, is a reliable, bug-free codebase.
Imaging undertook a large task this year with our server-client model requiring us
to rewrite our entire codebase. This rewrite presented an opportunity to build a 
proper test framework in parallel with our server-client code. A series of unit and
integration tests were developed for each component of the server and client.
