\section{Purpose}
\section{Market Representatives}
The market for this product consists of the AUVSI SUAS Competition judges.
They will determine the ultimate success of the product through its performance in the AUVSI SUAS Competition.
These judges provide a set of competition requirements that are our primary source for market requirements.
On September 14th, 2018 the competition requirements for the 2019 competition year were released.
From September 14th, 2018 to October 4th, 2018 the competition judges provide a comment period where team members request clarification on the requirements.
The current competition requirements and the comment period are our primary means of determining the market requirements.
In addition, our coach, Dr. Ning, and our sponsor, Dr. McLain, provide on-campus market representation, and feedback on our capstone documents. 

\section{Development of the Opportunity}

To determine the market requirements we started with a detailed study of the AUVSI SUAS competition requirements.
We determined the most crucial portions of the competition requirements by benchmarking individual team's performance in previous competitions (recorded in DJ-003), and by breaking down the relative scoring weights of the competition requirements (recorded in DJ-004). 
Using these studies, we prepared a set of requirements ready for feedback from our on campus market representatives.
On October 1st, 2018, we presented the requirements to Dr. Ning and Dr. McLain.
The feedback we received was positive, and encouraged us to refine the requirements through developing subsystem requirements in the future.
