We developed a system requirements matrix in conjunction with the AUVSI competition rules (see artifact RM-001). All system-wide performance measures were considered, and five measures listed in Table~\ref{tab:key_measures} were selected as key success measures. Over the course of the next two semesters, we will gauge the desirability of our product based on how well the product completes each of these performance measures. Each performance measure will be evaluated in an environment designed to mimic the competition.

* \textit{Average Waypoint Proximity} refers to the norm of the distance between the UAS and the waypoint location at the point when the autopilot considers the waypoint to be captured.

** \textit{Characteristics Identified} refers to the ability to classify the color, shape, and textual content of visual targets scattered on the ground using camera measurements.
