% The project contract will need to change as the design evolves and more information is known. In order to change the contract, the team and the sponsor must approve the changes. The team should place the contract under revision control, meaning that a version number must be attached to the contract, and a revision history should be maintained, with a record of the approvals for each change. Note that the project contract can only be changed by mutual agreement. Neither the team nor the sponsor can unilaterally declare changes in the contract. 
% The process used to propose, approve, and implement changes to the contract should be described in this section of the contract. It will generally use some form of Engineering Change Order procedure. See the Development Reference entry on Engineering Change Orders for suggestions.
