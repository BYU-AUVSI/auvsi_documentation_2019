\section{Purpose}

Last year's vision subsystem achieved less than 25\% of its total possible score. As such, it was determined that major improvements will be made at both the manual and autonomous levels.

\section{Concept Selected}

Vision's competition requirements are complex and as such required multiple concepts to fit into a larger system. 

\section{Definition}

This year's vision team is changing our system architecture that will allow for better
communication and organization. Instead of downloading each image and image state
onto someone's personal computer, the onboard computer will send image and vehicle state
date to a server on the ground. This server will have a compilied library of all images
and will attach classification data onto each image as it is manually processed. Our 
autonomous detection script will also be querying the server image database and outputing
its results. One team member will be monitoring the autonomous output ready to kill the 
program if it is sending too many false positives (which cause the team in incur a 
penalty). Our system architecture is outlined in Figure~\ref{fig:blockfig}.

Our autonomous classification system design is outlined in Figure~\ref{fig:autofig}.
These concepts for autonomous target recognition are based on methods that
other competition teams were able to successfully use at the comptition to
identify targets. We will continue to iterate on the autonomous process, but
we are confident that we can create a reliable and robust system for autonomous
target classification.
