\hline
\textbf{Idea}	&	\textbf{Description}	&	\textbf{Decision} &	\textbf{Rationale} \\
\hline
Skycrane & UGV is lowered on a rope from the UAV & Investigate & Would eliminate the need for most cushioning and control surfaces on the UGV\\
\hline
Fins & Fins are used to give minimal control to a fast falling UGV & Investigate & Would be smaller than full glider wings but still allow decent control\\
\hline
Glider & Unpowered aircraft is used to control the falling UGV & Investigate & Would likely provide the greatest amount to control\\
\hline
Parasail & A controllable parachute is used to steer the UGV & Dropped & Difficult and unknown controls \\
\hline
Control Grids & Similar to SpaceX, grids are used to steer the descent of the UGV & Dropped & Too complex for this application \\
\hline
Magnus Effect & Spin the wheels of the UGV in the air to generate lift and control UGV attitude & Modify & Could be used in conjunction with other methods but unlikely to have much effect by itself\\
\hline
Autogyro & Unpowered helicopter rotors are used to slow descent and blades can be tilted to control the drop & Dropped & Mechanism was considered too complex \\
\hline
Bounce & UGV uses some elastic material under it to decrease the time of impact & Dropped & Bouncing would likely not reduce the impact forces to survivable levels \\
\hline
Airbag & An airbag is inflated just before lading to cushion the drop & Dropped & Needs precise measurements to determine when to inflate airbag, Airbag inflation mechanism is likely to require dangerous materials\\
\hline
Springs & Springs are placed under the UGV to absorb the energy from the drop & Modify & Could be used to reduce impact energy but unlikely to be able to dissipate all by itself \\
\hline
Counterweight & A large mass is ejected downwards just before impact in order to slow UGV descent & Dropped & Requires ejecting a large mass at high acceleration which is likely to be dangerous and impractical\\
\hline
Crumple Zone & Use a deformable material to break and absorb energy when UGV impacts ground & Modify & Could be used to reduce impact energy but unlikely to be able to dissipate all by itself\\
\hline
Balloons & Use balloons to increase drag and provide some lift & Dropped & Would be large and impractical to carry on board the UAV \\
\hline
Parachute & Use a parachute to slow the descent of the UGV & Investigate & Simplest idea and almost guaranteed to work \\
\hline
Seedpod & Attach a single propeller blade to the UGV which would cause the UGV to spin and slow its descent similar to how maple seeds work & Dropped & The UGV is likely too heavy to implement this properly\\
\hline
Nothing & Make the UGV as rugged as possible and drop it from the UAV with no slowing mechanism & Dropped & Any UGV that is rugged enough to survive a 100 ft drop would be too heavy and bulky to carry on the UAV \\
\hline
Low Drop & Drop below the minimum allowable flight level and drop the UGV from a lower altitude for increased survivability & Dropped & Would violate rules that state we must remain above a certain altitude\\
\hline
