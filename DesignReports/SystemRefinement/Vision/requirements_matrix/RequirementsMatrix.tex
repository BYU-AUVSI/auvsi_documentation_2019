\section{Introduction}
Figure \ref{fig:imgReq} shows our updated requirements matrix for the imaging 
subsystem. Predicted and measured values, as well as market response were added 
where applicable. Some values can not be fully measured until multiple flight tests
are performed with imaging fully integrated into the plane.
