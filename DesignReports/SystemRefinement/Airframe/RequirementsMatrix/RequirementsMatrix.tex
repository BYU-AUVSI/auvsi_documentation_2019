\section{Introduction}
Figure \ref{fig:reqmatrix} (see next page) shows our updated Requirements Matrix for the Airframe subsystem. Section E has been updated with target, predicted, and measured values for our performance metrics. Some metrics were determined using models (see artifact AF-011), but could not be easily measured empirically. These metrics were placed in the predicted row and the measured value was assigned ``N/A".

%Figure needs to be enlarged and centered, some values in section E need to be updated before submission.
