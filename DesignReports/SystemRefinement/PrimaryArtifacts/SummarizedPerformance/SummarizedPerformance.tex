\section{Summary of System Performance}
%Performance summary for the system, which refers to supporting artifacts as needed

%Supporting Artifacts:
%•Test results obtained using models and/or prototypes. Pay special attention to Figure 2.12 inthe textbook as you consider the test resultsneeded. Note that you will need validation testing(not just performance testing) for SystemRefinement approval
%•Definitions of models and/or prototypes used intesting
%•Test procedures that were used to obtain theresults listed above
%•Computer files used in the testing work
%•Other detailed artifacts that support assessing theperformance of the system
%•Up-to-date approved project contract, revised asnecessary

Using our new simulation and payload drop planning algorithms we dropped our payload twice with an average
prediction accuracy of 17.7m. These drops were within our predicted performance values even though it was
a gusty day. In simulation, our payload drop planning algorithms have consistently been able to plot paths
that can drop the UGV while avoiding obstacles and competition boundaries.
