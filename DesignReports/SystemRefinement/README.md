- Intro, design description, performance, conclusion
## Primary artifacts
- High-level description of design, including subsystems (probably one for each subsystem)
- Performance summary for the system (one for each subsystem)
- System requirements matrix (with measured values and market response)
## Supporting artifacts

- Test results from models and prototypes
- Definitions of models and artifacts
- Test procedures used to get these results (Pre-flight checklist)
- Computer files used
