\section{Introduction}
% Appropriate (brief) background of the project. Indicate why the project is important. Share your project objective statement. Indicate the key success measures for the project.

The BYU AUVSI Capstone team is competing in the AUVSI-SUAS 2019 competition this summer. The mission portion of the competition requires a small unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to autonomously fly to given waypoints, avoid imaginary obstacles, identify visual and geospatial characteristics of objects on the ground, and accurately drop a payload consisting of an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) that is capable of autonomously driving to another location. Our team consists of four primary subteams: Airframe, Controls, Vision, and UGV. Because our system performance is primarily measured by the performance metrics of each subteam, the following sections in this artifact will summarize the description and performance of each subteam.

\section{Design Description}
% Briefly describe the design in words and with appropriate top-level pictures. The description should not be a detailed definition. The detailed definition is found in the artifacts. The description should provide an overview of the design that will make it easy for the reader to understand the details found in the artifacts. Refer to appropriate design artifacts as needed.

\subsection{Controls}
\subsection{Vision}
\subsection{UGV}

\section{System Performance}
% Summarize how well the design has been demonstrated to perform, compared with the key success measures and perhaps other important requirements. Summarize available market response data. Summarize the kind of tests that were performed with prototypes or engineering models to measure or predict the performance. Refer to appropriate testing and analysis artifacts as needed.

\subsection{Airframe}
\subsection{Controls}
\subsection{Vision}
\subsection{UGV}

\section{Conclusion}
% Holistically evaluate the desirability of the design based on the evidence present in the previous section and the artifacts. Make recommendations for resolving any issues that have shown up in your testing. Discuss the next steps that the sponsor should take to move the product forward to release.
