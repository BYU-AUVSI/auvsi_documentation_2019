Design, build, and test an unmanned aerial system capable of autonomous flight, obstacle avoidance, visual object detection, and payload delivery by April 1, 2019 with a budget of \$3,500 and 2,500 man hours. 

Overall, I think itâ€™s a pretty solid division. One concern would be with choosing and implementing a new path planning system; aside from obstacle avoidance, the path planner is actually working quite well. Perhaps we should consider a different focus for that sub-sub group.
