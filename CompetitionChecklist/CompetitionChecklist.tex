\section{Purpose}

The purpose of this artifact is to keep an up-to-date, standard protocol for safe, efficient, professional competition performance. It is important that all test flights are run systematically, and according to the procedures and timelines outlined in this document.

\section{Assignments}

The following roles should be assigned before the competition:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Saftey Pilot:} required by the competition rules
  \item \textbf{Groundstation Operator:} gets missions from the Interoperability Server and approves paths
  \item \textbf{Interoperability Server Operator:} sets up and manages the Interoperability Server
  \item \textbf{Judges Server:} sets up and manages the Judges Server and receives submissions, which are reported to the Scoring Manager
  \item \textbf{Image Classification Server Operator:} sets up and manages the Image Classification Server and submits image objects
  \item \textbf{Manual Image Classification Specialists:} manually classify images
  \item \textbf{Scorers:}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \textit{\textbf{Scoring Manager:} collects subscores and calculates the final competition score}
      \item \textit{\textbf{Waypoint/Obstacle Proximity Scorer:} post-processes rosbag data to determine the proximity to each waypoint and number of obstacles hit and submits to the Scoring Manager}
      \item \textit{\textbf{UGV Proximity Scorer:} records the latitude and longitude of the UGV landing and final locations and reports to the Scoring Manager}
      \item \textit{\textbf{Timeline Scorer:} clocks and records the time and outcome (e.g., forgot the Pre-mission Brief, payload did not deploy, 10~minutes timeout was used, etc.) of each segment of the competition. This includes 20~minutes of preparation and briefing, up to 30~minutes of flight, up to 10~minutes of grounded post-processing, and 10~minutes of clean up. The Timeline Scorer reports a high-level mission summary and timeline to the Scoring Manager.}
      \item \textit{\textbf{Image Classification Scorer:} compares the submitted image objects received from the Judges Server Operator to actual image characteristics and reports to the Scoring Manager}
    \end{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Team Lead:} reviews and follows the Competition and Field Flight Checklists, and gives the Pre-Mission Brief to the judges.
  \item \textbf{Plane Takeoff Specialist:} tosses the plane during takeoff
  \item \textbf{UAS Setup Crew:} sets up the BYU-AUVSI network and troubleshoots problems
  \item \textbf{Airframe Crew:} assembles and prepares the airframe for flight and troubleshoots problems
\end{itemize}
