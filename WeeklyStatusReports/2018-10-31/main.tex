\section{Goals for the Past Week}

The following is a list of our goals for the past week, as well as descriptions of their completion and/or progress:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Get ready for our Concept Development design review}\\
As of today, we've submitted the initial drafts of our concept development artifacts, and are now in the process of preparing our presentation for Friday. We're attaching our completed initial draft for your review.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Goals for the Coming Week}

The following is a list of our goals for the coming week, as well as details about how we plan to accomplish them:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Finish the concept development stage}\\
If necessary, we will make revisions to our artifacts and submit them within seven days. After that, we will be able to focus exclusively on progress for the competition for a couple of months, which is exciting.
\item \textbf{Get last year's control and interop schemes up and running in simulation}\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item Be able to launch the entire path planning/groundstation system in simulation, and send waypoints to the plane
	\item Get the Interop server serving up mock missions in simulation
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Run tests in a wind tunnel to evaluate our airspeed and barometer sensors}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Please send us any feedback with regards to the progress we've made, as well as our plans for the coming week.}
