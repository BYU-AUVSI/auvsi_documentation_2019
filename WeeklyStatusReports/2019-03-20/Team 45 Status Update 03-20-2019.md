# Capstone Team 45 Status Update 03-20-2019

The following is a list of status updates and goals for each of the four subteams:

* * *

## Airframe

(*Ryan Anderson, Tyler Critchfield, Kameron Eves*)

**Last Week:**

- Completed as much as currently possible for the new airframe. We're waiting on soldering. We are waiting for further development to add the payload door.

**Next Week:**

- Finish soldering on the new plane
- Perform an R/C flight test
- Potentially begin constructing payload door

## Controls

(*Andrew Torgesen, Brady Moon, John Akagi*)

**Last Week:**

- Updated the software on the plane with the new estimator and did some testing on the ground to make sure everything worked
- Created a vanilla RRT path planner
- Created much of the central mission planner node

**Next Week:**

- Continue developing path planner and mission planner
- **DO A LOT OF FLIGHT TESTS, focusing on getting hard measurements for all of our key success measures and our requirements matrix items**.

We are going to focus strongly on flying as much in the field as we can to get measured values for all of our key success measures.

## UGV

(*Jacob Willis, Derek Knowles, Brandon McBride*)

**Last Week:**

- Target drop path planner can plot a point to drop it
- Continuing to program payload drop algorithm for new flight software
- Set up flight controller on the UGV. We can give it PWM commands for steering and driving.
- The steering commands work great, however there is a clicking in the motor that drives the UGV.

**Next Week:**

- Working on getting  gps to work with ugv controller board
- Continuing to program payload drop algorithm for new flight software. To this end, we will *obtain drop time measurements next week* for the algorithm.

## Vision

(*Tyler Miller, Jake Johnson, Connor Olsen*)

**Last Week:**

- Finished Unit Tests for geolocation algorithm (Connor)
- Timestamp synchronization for camera (Tyler)
- Running test data on new target images (Jake)

**Next Week:**

- Begin working on search planner (Connor)
- Continue working on timestamp synchronization (Tyler)
- Obtain measurements in hardware and attempt to classify features and record the results (Tyler and Jake)

Please send us any feedback with regards to the progress we've made, as well as our plans for the coming week.
