\section{Goals for the Past Week}

The following is a list of our goals for the past week, as well as descriptions of their completion and/or progress:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Purchase the new airframe with backups}\\
We have purchased three new airframes, and since our old airframe is busted from repeated crashes, we will use one of our new airframes for the mock competition on December 14\textsuperscript{th}. Our airframe subteam is beginning to outfit the plane with the needed components for flying RC.
\item \textbf{Upgrade ROSFlight to the F4 chip}\\
We have purchased a couple of F4 chips, according to the recommendations of various members of the MAGICC Lab. We have made plans to integrate the new chip into our system with the new airframe.
\item \textbf{Set up a programmatic way to generate missions on the interop server}\\
This goal has been postponed due to other things coming up, such as creating a team-wide preflight checklist and investigating more thorough methods of testing comm links. We hope to have this goal accomplished by next week
\item \textbf{Consolidate controls code for easier launching and maintaining}
We are also still in the process of accomplishing this goal.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Goals for the Coming Week}
