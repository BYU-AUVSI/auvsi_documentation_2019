\section{Goals for the Past Week}

Since the last status update, we've only had a couple of days to work, so all of our goals remain the same for next week. As communicated in our meeting on Monday, we are still on track for our mock competition on December 14\textsuperscript{th}. Additionally, we are contacting a member of Dr. Ning's lab (Alex) about assisting us with flying the brand new airframe RC and tuning all relevant parameters.

\section{Goals for the Coming Week}

The following is a list of our goals for the coming week, as well as details about how we plan to accomplish them:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Interface the image server and the interop client} (\textit{Tyler Miller})
	\item \textbf{Finish constructing the image database, with all of its Data Access Objects} (\textit{Connor Olsen})
	\item \textbf{Get the image GUI operating fully as an image client with the database} (\textit{Derek Knowles, Brandon McBride})
	\item \textbf{Fully outfit the airframe with RC components and payload drop} (\textit{Ryan Anderson, Tyler Critchfield, Jacob Willis})
	\item \textbf{Get the controls code working in simulation} (\textit{Brady Moon, John Akagi, Kameron Eves, Andrew Torgesen})
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Please send us any feedback with regards to the progress we've made, as well as our plans for the coming week.}
