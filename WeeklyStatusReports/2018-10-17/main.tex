\section{Goals for the Past Week}

The following is a list of our goals for the past week, as well as descriptions of their completion and/or progress:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Wrap up Opportunity Development stage}\\
We obtained approval for our Opportunity Development stage, and will submit final artifact changes today.
\item \textbf{Fly RC and autonomous waypoint capture in a test flight}\\
We executed a flight test on Tuesday, and learned from our experience the following things:
\begin{itemize}
\item We need more practice launching the plane while flying RC
\item We need to conduct more thorough testing of our Ubiquiti network in outdoor environments
\item We need to familiarize ourselves more with the path planning and groundstation launch interfaces
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Register for the competition}\\
We completed this step, and are waiting for the registration fee to be sent to AUVSI.
\item \textbf{Get the Interop server serving up mock missions}\\
The completion of this step will be contingent upon familiarizing ourselves with the path planning and groundstation launch interfaces of last year.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Goals for the Coming Week}

The following is a list of our goals for the coming week, as well as details about how we plan to accomplish them:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Begin documentation for the Concept Development stage}\\
We have a list of artifacts which we want to create over the next three weeks. The biggest concept development challenge will be the UGV, which we want to tackle using a "hackathon" strategy, pitting sub-subteams' ideas against each other and deciding what's most effective.
\item \textbf{Patch up the plane and get more practice launching the plane while flying RC}\\
Ryan and Tyler will be principally responsible for patching up the plane, and Kameron and Brandon will be principally responsible for practicing the RC launch process.
\item \textbf{Find out what was causing the network connectivity issues at Tuesday's flight test}\\
\item \textbf{Get last year's control and interop schemes up and running in simulation}\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Be able to launch the entire path planning/groundstation system in simulation, and send waypoints to the plane
\item Get the Interop server serving up mock missions in simulation
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Run tests in a wind tunnel to evaluate our airspeed and barometer sensors}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Please send us any feedback with regards to the progress we've made, as well as our plans for the coming week.}
