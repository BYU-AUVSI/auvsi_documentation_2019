\section{Goals for the Past Week}

The following is a list of our goals for the past week, as well as descriptions of their completion and/or progress:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Finish the concept development stage}\\
We are essentially done with this goal. We have only to implement certain changes to our artifacts, and will complete our final submission this Friday.
\item \textbf{Get last year's control and interop schemes up and running in simulation}\\
The interop server and client are now running successfully, and are integrated with the rest of the control software from last year in simulation. We were able to successfully send waypoints to the plane in simulation, and are now playing around with that functionality to increase our familiarity with it.
\item \textbf{Run tests in a wind tunnel to evaluate our airspeed and barometer sensors}\\
This item has been superceded by the upcoming goal of upgrading ROSFlight to the F4 chip.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Goals for the Coming Week}

The following is a list of our goals for the coming week, as well as details about how we plan to accomplish them:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Purchase the new airframe with backups}\\
We have purchased a few new airframes based on our Concept Development decision, and are awaiting their arrival.
\item \textbf{Upgrade ROSFlight to the F4 chip}
\item \textbf{Set up a programmatic way to generate missions on the interop server}
\item \textbf{Consolidate controls code for easier launching and maintaining}
\end{enumerate}

Additionally, we've had the goal as a team to be more organized in having everyone on the team know what to be working on, and how it will contribute to our ultimate semester goal of \textbf{flying a mock competition with last year's system on December 14\textsuperscript{th}}. To that end, we are implementing tools such as the Trello board and Gantt chart depicted in the Appendix to make sure that all team members are aware of what needs to get done week-by-week to stay on track

\textbf{Please send us any feedback with regards to the progress we've made, as well as our plans for the coming week.}
